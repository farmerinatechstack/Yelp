# Yelp

Hours Taken: 17 - I spent a lot of time trying to teach myself auto-layouts because I could not get the cell layout to work based off of the in-class video. Then I realized that Tim provided an additional video on auto layouts and solved the problem within minutes.

Completed Milestones
[x] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height
[x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints
[x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
[x] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), radius (meters), deals (on/off).
[x] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
[x] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states.
[x] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
[x] Display some of the available Yelp categories (choose any 3-4 that you want).
